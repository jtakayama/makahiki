Setting Up the Makahiki and Vagrant Development Environment
===========================================================

These instructions configure a VirtualBox Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32-bit virtual 
machine with Vagrant, and download the Makahiki source code.

With the exception of Windows users, this guide assumes that you are using a 
Bourne-type shell (such as bash), which is the default on Mac OS X and Linux. 
Using a C-shell variant (like tcsh) is possible but not recommended.

Hardware Requirements
---------------------

A modern dual core CPU with 4 GB RAM should be sufficient to run the virtual machine.

Host Operating System Recommendations
-------------------------------------

The host OS is the OS that Vagrant and VirtualBox will be installed on. 
If your OS is not listed here, make sure that Vagrant and VirtualBox are 
available for your OS.

  * Windows 7 or 8
  * Mac OS X
  * Recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS Linux, or Ubuntu Linux

Install VirtualBox
------------------

Download VirtualBox for your host OS by following the instructions 
on the `VirtualBox downloads page`_.

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system in 
Chapter 02 of the `VirtualBox manual`_. Select **Yes** 
when asked to install drivers for USB support and VirtualBox Host-Only Networking.

.. _VirtualBox downloads page: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
.. _VirtualBox manual: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html

Install Vagrant
---------------

Download the `Vagrant installer`_ for your host OS. Vagrant 1.2.4 is recommended. 
Later versions may work but have not been tested.

Follow the `Vagrant installation instructions`_.

.. _Vagrant installer: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/
.. _Vagrant installation instructions: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

Open A Command Line Application
-------------------------------

Open a command line terminal on your system. The Windows terminal is called "Command Prompt." 
The Mac OS X terminal is called "Terminal." Most Linux systems with a graphical user interface 
call their terminal "Terminal."

Terminals usually begin each input prompt with the directory (also called a "folder") that is the user's 
current location in the file system. This is called the "working directory." Terminals 
usually end their input prompt with a special character (e.g., ``>``, ``#``, or ``$``).

When a user types a system command or program-specific command at the input prompt
and presses Enter, the operating system runs the program specified by the command.

.. note::
   In the rest of this article, a "``>``" is used to indicate a generic command prompt 
   on any host OS (Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux). Commands appearing after a "``>``" prompt 
   in this article should work on all three operating systems. Though some systems automatically 
   append a space after the prompt, you do not need to type a space before a command.
   
Windows
*******

Open a **Command Prompt** or type ``cmd.exe`` in **Run**.

An example of the Windows Command Prompt:

  .. figure:: figs/vagrant/example-windows-command-prompt.png
      :width: 600 px
      :align: center

The Windows command prompt opens with a working directory of ``C:\Users\<username>``, where ``<username>`` is the 
username of the current user. A Windows command prompt that has been opened with "Run as 
Administrator" opens in ``C:\Windows\system32``.

This guide does not require a Command Prompt to be run as an Administrator. However, 
administrative privileges may be required to resolve security and permissions issues related 
to Vagrant.

Mac OS X
********

Open a **Terminal**. If your default shell is not **bash**, type ``bash`` to temporarily 
switch to a **bash** shell. 

If you are using a recent version of OS X, you will not need to change the shell unless 
you changed the default shell in the past. The bash shell has been the default shell since 
OS X 10.3.

An example of the OS X Terminal:

  .. figure:: figs/vagrant/example-osx-terminal.png
      :width: 600 px
      :align: center

The ``~`` indicates that the user is in their user home directory. 

Linux
*****

Open a **Terminal**. If you are using a headless OS (an OS that does not have a graphical user interface), you are 
already in the Terminal.

Though every Linux distribution does this a little differently, most distributions 
open a terminal with a command prompt of the form::

  <username>@<computer_name>:<working_directory>$

An example of a Terminal shell window from Ubuntu Linux:

  .. figure:: figs/vagrant/example-ubuntu-terminal.png
      :width: 600 px
      :align: center

The ``~`` indicates that the user is in their user home directory. 
On Ubuntu, this is equivalent to ``/home/username``.
  
Download the Base Virtual Machine
---------------------------------

Download the base virtual machine image ``precise32`` from Vagrant's servers::

  > vagrant box add precise32 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box
  
.. note:: It is only necessary to download each base virtual machine ("box") 
   once per user account on the host OS. Once the "precise32" box has been downloaded, 
   it can be reused by Vagrant to create any virtual machines that specify "precise32" 
   in their Vagrantfiles. If your host OS is Windows and you switch to another 
   user account, you will need to download the "precise32" box again.
   
Download the Makahiki Source Code
---------------------------------

Downloading the Makahiki source code will create the "makahiki" directory.

There are two ways of obtaining the Makahiki source code: downloading it as 
an archive, or cloning the Git repository.

.. note:: The "makahiki" directory created by extracting the .zip file or 
   cloning the repository will be the directory Vagrant uses as a 
   reference point for accessing the virtual machine. This guide refers 
   to that directory as the "makahiki directory."

Download the Archive
********************

Follow these instructions if you do not have **Git** or **Git for Windows** and are 
unable to install them.

1. Go to https://github.com/csdl/makahiki
2. Click the button to "Download ZIP."
3. Extract the makahiki.zip file that is downloaded.
4. Move the extracted "makahiki" directory to the directory you want to start the Vagrant virtual machine from.

Clone the Repository
********************

Follow these instructions if you have installed or are going to install Git or Git for Windows.
  
Windows users can install `Git for Windows`_.

OS X and Linux users should be able to download Git for their operating 
system. See `GitHub's setup guide`_ for instructions.

.. _Git for Windows: http://git-scm.com/download/win
.. _Github's setup guide: http://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git

After installing Git or Git for Windows on your operating system, go back
to your Command Prompt or Terminal.

In the Command Prompt or Terminal, change your working directory to the 
directory you want to place the Makahiki source code directory in::

  > cd <path-to-directory>

For example, if you wanted the source code to be in ``C:\Users\username\Vagrant``, you 
would use the command ``cd C:\Users\username\Vagrant`` to change your working directory.

An example in Windows:

  .. figure:: figs/vagrant/windows-command-prompt-vagrant.png
      :width: 580 px
      :align: center

Then, enter this command in your Command Prompt or Terminal to 
clone the repository::

  > git clone http://github.com/csdl/makahiki.git

.. note:: If the "git clone" command does not work in the Windows Command Prompt, 
   you will need to use the "git clone" command in the Git for Windows terminal instead.
